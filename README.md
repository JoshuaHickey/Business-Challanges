**Python converter:**
Volume measurements for a container were measured through an IOT device and readings were transmitted in a hexidecimal format, with up to 100+ individual hexidecimal codes sent per reading. For our analytics team I was tasked to create a converter in python to read and store these readings in a csv file.

**CSV to AVRO converter**
A python script developed to assist new ingestions being added into the business. This script is used to generate schemas for the tables to be ingested.
